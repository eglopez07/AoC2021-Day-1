# AoC2021-Day-1
My solution to the Advent of Code 2021 Day 1 puzzles. You can see the puzzles [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1).

This was written in C++ and compiled using Visual Studio 2017. I prioritized finding a solution first, so the first version of this project was written without any checks on input.
I figure I can always go back to add these checks in later, and I did solve the puzzle in the end. I want to revisit this in the future to see how I can optimize it for time complexity.

This was a fun exercise and is relatively easy in terms of figuring out the actual logic. From that point, it is just a matter of deciding how to implement that logic.

I would explain it here, but I think it is more fun for people to understand the logic from viewing my code, or even attempting to solve it yourself. If you feel certain parts of my code are not self-explanatory, please let me know and I will try to see how to clarify it.
